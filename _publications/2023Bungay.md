Background - Physiological tremor is defined as an
involuntary and rhythmic shaking. Tremor of the hand is a key
symptom of multiple neurological diseases, and its frequency
and amplitude differs according to both disease type and disease
progression. In routine clinical practice, tremor frequency and
amplitude are assessed by expert rating using a 0 to 4 integer
scale. Such ratings are subjective and have poor inter-rater
reliability. There is thus a clinical need for a practical and
accurate method for objectively assessing hand tremor.

Objective - to develop a proof-of-principle method to measure
hand tremor amplitude from smartphone videos.

Methods - We created a computer vision pipeline that
automatically extracts salient points on the hand and produces
a 1-D time series of movement due to tremor, in pixels. Using
the smartphonesâ€™ depth measurement, we convert this measure
into real distance units. We assessed the accuracy of the method
using 60 videos of simulated tremor of different amplitudes
from two healthy adults. Videos were taken at distances of 50,
75 and 100 cm between hand and camera. The participants
had skin tone II and VI on the Fitzpatrick scale. We compared
our method to a gold-standard measurement from a slide rule.
Bland-Altman methods agreement analysis indicated a bias of
0.04 cm and 95% limits of agreement from -1.27 to 1.20 cm.
Furthermore, we qualitatively observed that the method was
robust to limited occlusion.

Clinical relevance - We have demonstrated how tremor
amplitude can be measured from smartphone videos. In conjunction
with tremor frequency, this approach could
