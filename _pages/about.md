Dr. Wong is an associate professor of Health Data Science and Health Informatics at the university of Leeds, and [Turing Fellow](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers).

He was previously a lecturer of AI in Healthcare at the University of Manchester (Dept. of Computer Science and Centre for Health Informatics).

David trained in Engineering Science (MEng, DPhil) at Brasenose college, University of Oxford and was a postdoctoral researcher within the
Institute of Biomedical Engineering. During his time in Oxford, he co-developed the SEND e-observation system, which is used to record vital sign observations
in the Oxford University Hospitals and South Warwickshire Foundation Trusts.

His research interests focus on investigating the impact of using continuous signals to assist clinicians in diagnosing and monitoring patients. Examples of specific research projects include:

- Vital sign data fusion to detect early deterioration in in-hospital patients using machine learning techiques.
- Diagnosis of cardiac conditions from ECG data using neural networks
- [Computer vision methods to quantify symptoms of movement disorders from video](https://computervisionneurology.github.io/)

He has taught across a range of undergraduate and graduate courses, including modules on:

- Foundations of Machine Learning (Manchester, MSc Computing)
- Machine Learning and advanced data analytics for health (Manchester, MSc Health Data Science)
- Decision Support Systems (Manchester/UCL, MSc Health Informatics)
- Engineering Mathematics (Oxford, MEng Engineering Science)
